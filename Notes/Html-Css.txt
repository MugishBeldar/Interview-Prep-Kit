                                           -[1].How do you add CSS to an HTML webpage?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Inline styles: You can add a style attribute to individual HTML elements, and use it to specify CSS styles.
//code
<p style="color: blue;">This text is blue.</p>
...
This method is useful for adding small styles to specific elements, but can be difficult to maintain if you have many elements or 
complex styles.

Internal stylesheet: You can add a <style> element to the <head> section of an HTML document, and use it to specify CSS styles 
for the entire page.
//code
<head>
    <style>
        p {
            color: blue;
        }
    </style>
</head>
...
This method is useful for adding styles to multiple elements or an entire webpage, but can be less flexible if you have multiple 
webpages or want to reuse styles.

External stylesheet: You can create a separate CSS file, and link to it from your HTML document using the link element in the <head> 
section.
//code
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
This method is the most flexible and easy to maintain, it allows you to reuse styles in multiple webpages and also make changes to 
your entire website in one file.

It's important to note that all the above methods will apply the CSS styles to the HTML elements, and the styles will be applied in
 the order they are loaded, so the last loaded will override previous styles with the same selectors and properties

                                                  -[3].What does HTML stand for?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a markup language used to create the structure and layout of web pages. 
HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to define the different parts of a webpage such as headings, paragraphs, images, links,
 and many other types of content.
HTML documents are made up of elements, which are represented by tags. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag, 
with the content of the element placed in between.
//code
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
In this example, the <p> tag is the opening tag and the </p> tag is the closing tag. The text "This is a paragraph" is the content
 of the element.
HTML also uses attributes to provide additional information about an element. For example, the href attribute is used in the <a> 
(anchor) tag to specify the URL of the linked webpage.
//code
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>
It's important to note that HTML is used to define the structure and layout of web pages, while CSS is used to control the presentation 
of those pages. Therefore, HTML creates the basic building blocks of a webpage and CSS is used to apply styles and design to it.

                                                -[4].What are the features of HTML5?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
HTML5 is the latest version of the HTML language and has several new features that were not present in previous versions. 
Some of the most notable features of HTML5 include:

Semantic elements: HTML5 includes new semantic elements, such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <figure> 
and <footer>, which give more meaning to the content of a webpage and make it easier for search engines and screen readers to 
understand the structure of a webpage.

Audio and video support: HTML5 includes built-in support for audio and video playback, which means that you no longer need to rely on
third-party plugins like Flash to play multimedia on a webpage.

Canvas: The <canvas> element in HTML5 allows you to create and manipulate graphics on a webpage using JavaScript.

Offline caching: HTML5 allows webpages to be cached in a user's browser, allowing them to be accessed offline.

Local storage: HTML5 allows web applications to store data locally on the user's device, which allows the application to load faster
and work offline.

Geolocation: The HTML5 Geolocation API allows web applications to access the user's location and display it on a map or use it for
other purposes.

Improved form controls: HTML5 introduces new form controls such as date pickers, search fields, and sliders, which make it easier 
to create forms and validate user input.

Improved web worker support: HTML5 includes support for web workers, which allows web pages to run JavaScript code in the background
 without freezing the user interface.

Flexible Box Layout: HTML5 provides more control over page layout with the new CSS display property: flex.

HTML5 is designed to be backward-compatible with previous versions of HTML, and is designed to work well with other web technologies
such as CSS and JavaScript.

                                      -[5].What are the different types of storage in HTML5? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
HTML5 provides several different types of storage options that web applications can use to store data locally on a user's device.
Some of the most common types of storage include:

1.Local storage: Local storage is a key-value store that allows web applications to store data locally on a user's device. The data
     stored in local storage is persistent and remains even after the browser is closed. Local storage has a maximum size of around 
     5-10MB, depending on the browser.
2.Session storage: Session storage is similar to local storage, but the data stored in session storage is only available for the 
      duration of a user's browsing session. Once the user closes the browser, the data stored in session storage is deleted.
3.IndexedDB: IndexedDB is a more powerful and flexible storage option that allows web applications to store large amounts of structured
     data. It provides a database-like interface for storing, querying and retrieving data, which makes it useful for offline web apps
     or apps that need to store large amounts of data.
4.Cookies: Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's device by a web server. They are typically used to store 
     user-specific information such as login credentials or preferences.
5.Cache API : Cache API is a storage option that allows web applications to store files and resources, such as images, scripts, 
     and stylesheets, locally on a user's device. This allows the application to load the resources quickly and work offline.
     It's worth noting that different types of storage options are suited for different use cases and have different advantages 
     and limitations. For example, cookies have a small maximum size, and may not be suitable for storing large amounts of data, 
     whereas Local storage and IndexedDB are more powerful and flexible storage options that can store large amounts of data.

                        -[6].What do the following mean in html ? <section>|<article>|<footer>|<nav>|<aside>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In HTML5, the <section>, <article>, <footer>, <nav>, and <aside> elements are semantic elements that give more meaning to the content
of a webpage and make it easier for search engines and screen readers to understand the structure of a webpage. These tags are 
block-level elements that are typically used to divide a webpage into different sections and provide a way to organize content in a 
logical and meaningful way.

<section>: The <section> element is used to group content together that has a similar theme or purpose. It defines a section of a 
web page, such as a chapter, a subsection, or a block of content.

<article>: The <article> element is used to identify a self-contained piece of content on a webpage. For example, a blog post,
a news story, a forum post, etc.

<footer>: The <footer> element is used to define the footer of a webpage, typically containing information such as the author, 
copyright information, and links to related content.

<nav>: The <nav> element is used to identify a section of a webpage that contains navigation links. It is typically used to create
navigation menus and other navigation-related content.

<aside>: The <aside> element is used to identify content that is related to the main content of the webpage, but not essential 
to understanding it. For example, it can be used to mark up a sidebar with related links, or a pull-quote from the main text.

Using these tags in your HTML document can make it more meaningful and accessible to users and search engines. It's also worth 
noting that these elements are not only useful for accessibility but they also give more flexibility while styling the webpage 
and can be useful when it comes to responsive design.

                                                 -[7].What are forms in HTML?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In HTML, forms are used to create a way for users to interact with a webpage by submitting data, such as text input, radio buttons, 
checkboxes, and file uploads. They are used to collect data from users and to send that data to a web server for processing.
The basic structure of a form in HTML is an opening <form> tag and a closing </form> tag, with various form elements, such as text
 inputs, checkboxes, and submit buttons, placed between them.
Here is an example of a simple form with a text input and a submit button:
//code
<form>
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
In this example, the <form> element creates a container for the form elements. The <label> element is used to create a text label
for the form input, and the <input> element is used to create the form control (a text input in this case)
There are many types of form controls that you can use in HTML, such as text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, select lists, and
more. Each type of form control has a unique set of attributes and properties that you can use to control its behavior and appearance.
Forms are often used in combination with a server-side script or a JavaScript to validate the data entered by the user before sending
it to the server and also to handle the form data on the client-side before sending it to the server.
It's also worth noting that forms can be used to interact with webpages in many ways that go beyond simply submitting data to a server.
For example, a form can be used to create dynamic interactions with a webpage, such as updating the page's content without reloading it,
or to trigger actions based on the data entered by the user.

                                                -[8].What are event listeners in HTML?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In HTML, event listeners are a way to add behavior to elements on a webpage by listening for events, such as a button click or a form 
submission, and then running a function in response. Event listeners can be used to create interactive and dynamic web pages that 
respond to user actions and input.
Event listeners are typically added to an element using JavaScript or a JavaScript library such as jQuery. The basic syntax for adding 
an event listener is as follows:
//code
element.addEventListener(event, function);
Where element is the element you want to add the event listener to, event is the type of event you want to listen for (e.g., "click", 
"submit", "mouseover"), and function is the function that you want to run when the event occurs.
For example, you can add a click event listener to a button element that runs a function when the button is clicked:
//code
<button id="myButton">Click me</button>
<script>
   var button = document.getElementById("myButton");
   button.addEventListener("click", function() {
      console.log("Button clicked!");
   });
</script>
Event listeners can be added to many different types of elements such as input fields, form elements, and even body element and many 
different types of events such as click, mouseover, keydown, load and so on.
Event Listeners can also be removed from elements when they are no longer needed. The method to remove the event listener is 
removeEventListener(event,function).
Event listeners are powerful tool that allows you to make your webpages interactive and responsive to user actions. 
They can also be used to create dynamic effects and animations, validate forms, and create other types of interactions.

                                                   -[9].what is onload event?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In HTML, the onload event is a JavaScript event that is triggered when a web page or an image has finished loading. It is typically 
used to perform tasks such as initializing variables, setting up event listeners, and running functions when the page loads.
The onload event can be added to the <body> or <img> element of an HTML document, and is commonly used in the following way:
//code
<body onload="initialize()">
...
</body>
In the above example, the function initialize() will be called when the page has finished loading. The function can contain any 
JavaScript code that you want to run when the page loads, such as setting up event listeners, initializing variables, or manipulating 
the page's content.
You can also add the event listener for onload event in javascript
//code
window.onload = function(){
  //JavaScript code here
}
This event is also used to make sure that some elements on the page are ready such as images, other scripts or the DOM.
It's worth noting that if there are multiple onload events on the page, they will be executed in the order they appear on the page
.Also, be mindful that if you have many elements on the page that need to load, the onload event may fire later than expected and make 
some elements unavailable when you are trying to manipulate them.

                                                    -[10].What is scroll event?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In HTML, the scroll event is a JavaScript event that is triggered when a user scrolls an element on a webpage. This event is commonly 
used to perform tasks such as updating the position of fixed elements, loading new content, or running animations as the user scrolls.
The scroll event can be added to any element that is scrollable, such as the <body>, <div>, or <section> element, and is commonly used
in the following way:
//code
var element = document.getElementById("scrollable-element");
element.addEventListener("scroll", function() {
  // JavaScript code here
});
In the example above, an event listener is added to an element with id "scrollable-element" that listens for the scroll event and runs 
the function. The function can contain any JavaScript code that you want to run when the event occurs, such as updating the position of
fixed elements, loading new content, or running animations.

                                                 -[11].How do you use Geo Location API?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
The Geolocation API in HTML5 allows web applications to access the user's location and use it for various purposes, such as displaying 
the user's location on a map or providing location-based services. To use the Geolocation API, you need to create a JavaScript function 
that gets the user's location using the navigator.geolocation object.
Here is an example of a function that gets the user's location and displays it in an alert box:
//code
function getLocation() {
    if (navigator.geolocation) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(showPosition);
    } else { 
        alert("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
    }
}
function showPosition(position) {
    alert("Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude + 
    " Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude);
}
In the example above, the getLocation function checks if the browser supports the Geolocation API using the navigator.geolocation 
object. If it does, it calls the navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() method, passing it the showPosition function as an argument.
 This function will be called with the user's position as an argument.
The showPosition function takes the position object as an argument which is passed from navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() 
method, it then extracts latitude and longitude from the position object and shows it in an alert box.
It's worth noting that using the Geolocation API is subject to the user's permission. Before accessing the user's location, 
the browser will prompt the user to grant permission. If the user denies permission, the navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          - [12].How do you know if a user is offline or not? What API does the browser provide for that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
The browser provides the Navigator.onLine property and the window.ononline and window.onoffline events to check if a user is online
 or offline.
The Navigator.onLine property returns a Boolean value indicating whether the browser is in online or offline mode. The property 
returns true if the browser is online and false if it is offline. You can use this property to check the user's current connection
 status:
//code
if (navigator.onLine) {
  // Browser is online
} else {
  // Browser is offline
}
The window.ononline and window.onoffline events are fired when the browser goes online or offline, respectively. You can use these 
events to run code when the user's connection status changes:
//code
window.addEventListener('online', function() {
  console.log('You are online');
});
window.addEventListener('offline', function() {
  console.log('You are offline');
});
It's worth noting that the Navigator.onLine property and the window.ononline and window.onoffline events are part of the HTML5 web 
standard and are supported by most modern browsers, but not all. And be mindful that it is not guaranteed to be accurate for all the 
devices and the network types.

                                          - [13].How do you use Video and Audio tags?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
The HTML <video> and <audio> tags are used to embed video and audio content into an HTML document. These tags provide a way to play 
multimedia content natively in a browser without the need for additional plug-ins or software.
The basic syntax for using the <video> tag is as follows:
//code
<video src="path/to/video.mp4" controls>
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
The src attribute is used to specify the location of the video file, and the controls attribute is used to display the video
player controls.
The <audio> tag is similar to the <video> tag but it is used for audio files and it can be like:
//code
<audio src="path/to/audio.mp3" controls>
    Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio>
Both tags have many attributes and properties to customize the player like autoplay, loop, poster, preload and so on.
For example, you can use the autoplay attribute to start playing the video automatically when the page loads, the loop attribute 
to repeat the video and the poster attribute to display an image until the video is played.
//code
<video src="path/to/video.mp4" controls autoplay loop poster="path/to/poster.jpg">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
It's worth noting that different browsers support different video and audio formats, so it is important to provide multiple 
sources for the video or audio using the <source> tag. This allows the browser to use the first compatible format it can play.
//code
<video controls>
   <source src="path/to/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   <source src="path/to/video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
   Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
By using the <audio> and <video> tags you can natively add multimedia content to your web pages and make them more engaging 
and interactive. It's also worth noting

                                 </html>

                                          - what does above boilerplate code means?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
The code you provided is an example of an HTML document structure.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration tells the browser that this document is an HTML document.
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page, and all other elements must be descendants of this element.
<html lang="en"> attribute indicates the language of the document, in this case it's english.
The <head> element contains meta information about the document, such as the document's title, character encoding, and viewport settings. 
It also can include links to stylesheets and scripts.
<meta charset="UTF-8"> specifies the character encoding for the document, UTF-8 is a widely used character encoding that supports most of
 the characters and symbols in the world.
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> is to ensure that the website is rendered in the latest and most compatible version
 of Internet Explorer.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> it specifies the viewport (the visible area of the web page) and 
the initial scale of the page when it's first loaded.
The <title> element defines the title of the document, the title appears on the browser's title bar or in the tab of the page.
The <body> element contains the visible content of the HTML document, such as text, images, links, and other interactive elements.
So, this is a basic skeleton of an HTML document, you can add more elements and attributes as per your needs and requirements.

                                                -[15] what are HTML Attributes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In HTML, an attribute is a property of an HTML element that provides additional information about how the element should appear or behave.
Attributes are added to the opening tag of an element, and are made up of a name and a value. For example, the src attribute is used to 
specify the source URL of an image in an img element, like this: <img src="image.jpg">. Some attributes, like the disabled attribute of 
a button element, do not require a value and are instead used to toggle a certain behavior or state on or off.

There are many attributes available in HTML, some of which are specific to certain elements, while others can be used with a wide variety 
of elements. Common attributes include class, id, src, href, alt, style, width, height, title, target, disabled, checked, readonly, 
required, type, value, placeholder, name, and id

It's worth noting that some attributes are considered global, which means that they can be used on any element. Other attributes are 
specific to certain elements.

            -[15] What is the difference between a block element and an inline element? Give few examples of block 
                                           and inline tags which we have in HTML.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In HTML, block elements create a rectangular block on the page, and take up the full width of their parent container. 
They create a new line before and after the element. Examples of block elements include: <div>, <p>, <h1>, <form>, <header>, <footer>.

Inline elements, on the other hand, only take up as much width as necessary, and do not create a new line before or after the element.
Examples of inline elements include: <span>, <a>, <img>, <strong>, <em>

                                                   -[2].What does CSS stand for?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a 
markup language.
It is primarily used to style HTML and XML documents, but can also be applied to other types of documents. It can be used to control 
the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a webpage or document, and separate the presentation of a document from its 
structure.
Cascading refers to the way CSS styles cascade down from a parent element to its child elements and the way it takes priority over 
earlier styles. With the use of CSS, one can style multiple pages at once and it gives a more organized way to handle presentation 
and styling of a document.

                                                   - [1]  What are CSS selectors?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
CSS selectors are patterns used to select the elements from the HTML document that a set of CSS styles will be applied to. 
There are several different types of selectors available, including element, class, id, and attribute selectors. Selectors 
can also be combined together to select elements based on multiple criteria. For example, you can use a combination of class
 and element selectors to select all of the paragraphs inside a specific div with a certain class.
Example:
//code
<div class="example">
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</div>
selector : div.example p
output: all <p> element inside <div class="example">
//code
div.example p {
  color: red;
}
This CSS rule would select all the <p> elements that are inside a <div> element with the class "example" and set the text color to red.

CSS variables, also known as CSS custom properties, are a way to store and reuse values in a CSS stylesheet. They allow you to 
define a value once and then reference it multiple times throughout your stylesheet, making it easier to maintain and update
 your styles.
CSS variables are defined using the -- prefix and are set using the var() function. For example:
//code
:root {
  --main-color: blue;
}

p {
  color: var(--main-color);
}
In this example, the --main-color variable is set to the value "blue" on the :root selector, which is a pseudo-class that targets 
the highest level element in the document. The value can be accessed and used by any other element on the css by var(--main-color);
CSS variables can also be scoped to specific elements or classes, which means that they can only be accessed by elements within 
a certain part of the document tree.
It is supported by most modern browser, with fallback for the older one
CSS variables have some constraints, for example, it can only be used on property values, not on property names, or selector,
 and you can't do mathematical operations on it, instead you can use calc() function for that

                              - [3]  What is the difference between position absolute and relative?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In CSS, the position property is used to specify the type of positioning method used for an element. There are four possible values
 for the position property: static, relative, absolute, and fixed.

static is the default value for the position property. Elements with a static position are not affected by any positioning properties,
 and they remain in the normal flow of the document.

relative positioning is used to position an element relative to its normal position. For example, if you set the top and left 
properties on a relatively-positioned element, it will move relative to where it would be in the normal flow of the document. 
However, it still takes up space in the layout and affects the position of other elements.

absolute positioning is used to position an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, instead of the viewport like fixed.
 However, if none of the ancestor has a position property other than static, it will positioned relative to the viewport. 
 The element is removed from the normal flow of the document and does not take up any space. It can overlap other elements.
fixed positioning is used to position an element relative to the viewport, so it always stays in the same place even when the page
 is scrolled. like absolute but it's relative to viewport
To summarise, the main difference between relative and absolute positioning is that relative positioning positions an element 
relative to its normal position in the layout, while absolute positioning positions an element relative to its nearest positioned
 ancestor, if none, relative to the viewport. Additionally, relative positioned element still occupy space and affect layout, 
 but absolute positioned elements do not.

                                                 - [4]  Create a search bar with CSS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
//body
<div class="search-container">
  <form>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Search...">
    <button type="submit">Search</button>
  </form>
</div>
...
//css
.search-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.search-container input[type=text] {
  width: 60%;
  padding: 12px 20px;
  margin: 8px 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  border: 2px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
}

.search-container button[type=submit] {
  width: 20%;
  background-color: #4CAF50;
  color: white;
  padding: 14px 20px;
  margin: 8px 0;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.search-container button[type=submit]:hover {
  background-color: #45a049;
}
This creates a search bar that consists of an input field and a submit button, both placed within a form element. The container
 element is styled using the CSS flexbox layout to center the elements horizontally and vertically. The input field has a width 
 of 60%, and the submit button has a width of 20%.
The input field is given padding, a border and border-radius for styling. The submit button is given background color, color and 
border-radius.
It's a basic example, you can change and add more styling as per your requirement.

                                                     - [5]  What is Box Model?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
The box model in CSS is a layout concept that describes how the dimensions of an HTML element are calculated. It defines a 
rectangular box for each element, with each box having content, padding, borders, and margins. The box model is used by all web
 browsers to lay out and render HTML elements.
The different parts of the box model are:
Content: The area that contains the element's content, such as text or images. This is the innermost part of the box and is 
represented by the width and height properties in CSS.
Padding: The space between the content and the border. It is represented by the padding properties in CSS (padding-top, padding-right,
 padding-bottom, padding-left).
Border: The border that surrounds the padding and the content. It is represented by the border properties in CSS
 (border-top, border-right, border-bottom, border-left).
Margin: The space outside the border. It is represented by the margin properties in CSS (margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom,
 margin-left).
By default, the width and height properties in CSS refer to the width and height of the content box. However, you can also specify
 the width and height of the entire box by including the padding, border, and margins. To do this, you can use the box-sizing
  property with a value of "border-box".
Understanding how the box model works and how to control it is an essential part of working with layout in CSS, so that you can 
control the size and position of elements, and achieve the desired layout for your web pages.

                                                     - [6]  What is a flex-box?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
A flexbox, or flexible box, is a layout method in CSS that makes it easy to create flexible and responsive designs. It allows you to 
align and distribute elements within a container, and control the layout of elements in a two-dimensional way, similar to grid layout.
With flexbox, you can lay out elements horizontally or vertically, align them along the main axis or the cross axis, and control the
 size and position of elements using flex properties.
A flex container is the parent element in which flex items are laid out. It's created by setting the display property to "flex" 
or "inline-flex" on the container element.
//code
.container {
  display: flex;
}
A flex item is a direct child of a flex container and it's the elements that are laid out and aligned according to the flexbox 
layout rules.
The main idea behind flexbox is to provide a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container. 
It works well for elements that have to be laid out in a single dimension, you can control the layout more precisely and make your
 page responsive without using media queries and javascript.
Flexbox is supported by all modern browsers, including Internet Explorer 11 and Edge 12 and later version.
It's a powerful layout method for responsive design, can be used for several types of layout, for example, navigation bars, form
 elements, and grid layouts.

                                 - [7]  What does justify-content, justifyItems, justifySelf mean?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In CSS, justify-content, justify-items, and justify-self are properties that are used to align elements within a flex container or 
grid container.
justify-content is a property that is applied to the flex container and it controls the alignment of elements along the main axis 
(horizontally for row layout, vertically for column layout). For example, you can use justify-content: center; to center the elements
 within a row flex container.
justify-items is a property that is applied to the flex container, it controls the alignment of individual items along the main axis,
 if any item has a set value for justify-self it will take precedence, otherwise it will align all items within the container
justify-self is a property that is applied to individual flex items and it allows you to override the value set by justify-items to
 align a specific flex item along the main axis.
....
Both properties accept several values, like:
flex-start: align items to the start of the main axis
flex-end: align items to the end of the main axis
center: align items to the center of the main axis
baseline: align items along their baselines
stretch: stretch items to fill the container along the main axis
These properties are used in conjuction with other alignment properties like align-items, align-content and align-self to create a
 flexible and responsive layout.
It is important to note that justify-content and align-content properties are used for the container and have effect on the empty 
space between the items, while justify-self, justify-items, align-self and align-items are used for the items.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    - [8]  What do AlignItems, AlignContent, and AlignSelf mean?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In CSS, align-items, align-content, and align-self are properties that are used to align elements within a flex container or grid
 container.
align-items is a property that is applied to the flex container and it controls the alignment of elements along the cross axis 
(vertically for row layout, horizontally for column layout). For example, you can use align-items: center; to center the elements
 within a column flex container.
align-content is similar to align-items, but it applies to the space between the elements (rows or columns) inside the container.
 It's used when there is more than one line of elements and you want to align the rows (or columns) within the container.
align-self is a property that is applied to individual flex items and it allows you to override the value set by align-items
 to align a specific flex item along the cross axis.
...
Both properties accept several values, like:
flex-start: align items to the start of the cross axis
flex-end: align items to the end of the cross axis
center: align items to the center of the cross axis
baseline: align items along their baselines
stretch: stretch items to fill the container along the cross axis
Just like justify-content, justify-items, justify-self these properties can be used to control the layout and positioning of elements 
within a flex container, providing a powerful and flexible way to create responsive designs.

                                                     - [9]  What are grids?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Grids in CSS refer to the Grid Layout module, a layout method that allows you to create a two-dimensional grid of elements on a 
web page, similar to a table. The grid is made up of rows and columns, and elements within the grid are placed into grid cells, 
which can span multiple rows and columns. This allows for precise control over the size and position of elements, making it well
 suited for creating complex and responsive layouts.
The grid layout is created by setting the display property to grid on the parent container element, and then using various grid-related
 properties to specify the number of rows and columns, as well as the placement of elements within the grid.

//body
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">3</div>
  <div class="grid-item">4</div>
  <div class="grid-item">5</div>
  <div class="grid-item">6</div>
</div>
...
//css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 10px;
}
In this example, the parent container element is set to use the grid layout, and the grid-template-columns property is used to create a 
3-column grid. The grid-gap property is used to add spacing between the grid cells.
Grids are highly customizable, you can specify the size of the rows and columns, placement and spanning of items, align and justify items, 
gaps, and many more features. It's a powerful layout method, it provides a systematic way of laying out, aligning and adjusting elements
 on a webpage and can help to create responsive and adaptable designs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    - [10]  What are the differences between Flex and Grids?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Flexbox and Grid Layout are both layout methods in CSS that allow you to create flexible and responsive designs for web pages. However,
 they have some key differences:
Dimension: Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method, it is mainly used to layout items in a single dimension, either in a row or a 
column. Grid Layout, on the other hand, is a two-dimensional layout method that allows you to create a grid of rows and columns on a 
web page, similar to a table.
Flexibility: Flexbox is best suited for laying out elements in a single dimension, with the ability to control the alignment, distribution,
 and size of elements along that dimension. Grid Layout, with its two-dimensional layout, provides a more powerful and flexible way to 
 create complex and responsive layouts, with fine-grained control over the positioning and alignment of elements in both rows and columns.

Axis: Flexbox layout operates on a main axis and a cross axis, The main axis is the primary axis along which the flex items are laid out
 and the cross axis is the axis perpendicular to the main axis. Grid layout also has rows and columns that define the main axis and cross
  axis, but it is more explicit and easy to understand
Use case: Flexbox is well suited for creating simple layouts like navigation bars, form elements and small scale grid-like structures. 
Grid layout, on the other hand, is more appropriate for creating complex and responsive layouts such as grid-based layouts, image 
galleries, and page layouts, where elements need to be positioned in two dimensions and span multiple rows or columns.
In summary, Flexbox and Grid Layout are both powerful layout methods, but they have different strengths and use cases. Flexbox is great 
for simple one-dimensional layouts, while Grid Layout is ideal for creating more complex, two-dimensional layouts. You can also use them 
together, using flexbox to align items within a grid container, making it even more flexible.

                                       - [11]  What is specificity, and how do you calculate it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Specificity is a term used in CSS to determine which CSS styles will be applied to an element when there are multiple styles that could 
potentially apply to it. Specificity is a numerical value assigned to a CSS rule, based on the types of selectors used in that rule, 
which is then used to determine which styles will be applied to an element when there are conflicting styles.
There are three different types of selectors that can be used to select elements in a web page: element selectors, class selectors,
 and ID selectors. Each type of selector has a different level of specificity, and the specificity value is calculated by counting 
 the number of each type of selector used in a CSS rule.
The specificity value is calculated as follows:
For each element selector, add 1 point
For each class selector, add 10 points
For each ID selector, add 100 points
For example, a CSS rule that uses an element selector and two class selectors would have a specificity value of 1 x 1 + 10 x 2 = 21.
In case two or more CSS rules target the same element, the one with the highest specificity value wins. If the specificity values 
are the same, the rule that comes last in the stylesheet is applied.
It's important to note that the !important keyword also has a very high specificity. When used,

                                                       - [12]  What are media queries?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Media queries are a feature in CSS that allows you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or screen 
on which a web page is being viewed. They allow you to create a responsive design that adjusts to the screen size and resolution 
of the device being used to view the page, so that the page can be optimized for different devices and screen sizes.
A media query consists of a media type (such as 'screen' or 'print') and one or more expressions that check for certain conditions,
 such as the width, height, and resolution of the device. The styles inside the media query are only applied if the conditions 
 specified in the query are met.
Here is an example of a media query that changes the font-size of the body text when the viewport width is less than 600px:
//code
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
}
You can also chain multiple media queries together. This can help you to write cleaner, more maintainable code.
//code
@media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 800px) {
  /* styles here */
}
Media queries are becoming more important as the number of different devices and screen sizes that can access the web continues to 
increase. They allow developers to create designs that adapt to different devices, providing a better user experience for users
 accessing the website from different devices.
It's worth noting that media queries are not only used for responsiveness but also for accessibility, for example, to adjust font 
size, contrast or even hide certain elements for users with specific needs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           - [13]  What is the difference between min-width and max-width in media queries?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In media queries, min-width and max-width are used to specify the minimum and maximum width of the viewport, respectively, at which a 
certain set of styles should be applied.
min-width is used to apply styles when the viewport width is greater than or equal to a certain value. For example, the following
 media query applies styles when the viewport width is at least 600 pixels:
//code
@media (min-width: 600px) {
  /* styles here */
}
max-width, on the other hand, is used to apply styles when the viewport width is less than or equal to a certain value. For example, 
the following media query applies styles when the viewport width is no more than 800 pixels:
//code
@media (max-width: 800px) {
  /* styles here */
}
You can also combine min-width and max-width in a single media query. For example, the following media query will apply styles when 
the viewport width is between 600 pixels and 800 pixels:
//code
@media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 800px) {
  /* styles here */
}
In summary, min-width is used to apply styles when the viewport width is greater than or equal to a certain value and max-width is 
used to apply styles when the viewport width is less than or equal to a certain value. This is useful when you want to create a
 responsive design that changes depending on the screen size.

                                              - [14]  What are animation and keyframe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Animation in CSS allows you to bring elements to life by applying smooth transitions between different styles over a period of time.
 Keyframes are a way to define different styles for different points in an animation, similar to how frames in a movie are used to
  create the illusion of motion.
Here is an example of a simple animation that changes the color of a button element over a period of 3 seconds:
//code
button {
  animation: color-change 3s;
}
@keyframes color-change {
  from { background-color: blue; }
  to { background-color: red; }
}
The animation property is used to define the animation, and it takes several values like the name of the animation (color-change),
 the duration of the animation (3s) and other properties like animation-timing-function which controls how the animation progresses.
The @keyframes rule is used to define the styles for different points in the animation. In the example above, the from and to keywords 
are used to define the start and end styles of the animation.
You can also specify keyframes with percentage, to define different styles at different points in the animation, this allows for much
 more advanced animation.
//code
@keyframes color-change {
  0%   { background-color: blue; }
  25%  { background-color: yellow; }
  50%  { background-color: green; }
  100% { background-color: red; }
}
Using animations and keyframes, you can create a wide range of effects, such as hover effects, scrolling effects, and more. 
It can be used for adding some dynamic element to your page and provide a good user experience.

                                         - [1]  How do you build an infinite scrolling page?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
An infinite scrolling page is a web page that automatically loads new content as the user scrolls down the page. To create an infinite
 scrolling page, you will need to use JavaScript to detect when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page and then load new 
 content dynamically. Here are the general steps you can follow:
Create a container element for the content that will be loaded dynamically. This will usually be a div or a section element that has
 a fixed height and an overflow property set to auto.
Use JavaScript to detect when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page. You can use the scroll event and the clientHeight,
 scrollHeight and scrollTop properties of the container element to determine if the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page.
//code
const container = document.querySelector('.container');
container.addEventListener('scroll', function() {
  if (container.scrollTop + container.clientHeight >= container.scrollHeight) {
    // load more content
  }
});
Once the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page, load more content using a technique such as an XMLHttpRequest (XHR) or the 
Fetch API, which allows you to request additional data from a server without refreshing the page.
//code
const loadMore = function() {
  // make the request for more content
  fetch('/path/to/data').then(response => {
    // parse the response and append the new content to the container
  });
}
Append the new content to the container element. You can use JavaScript to create new elements, set their content and styles, 
and then append them to the container element.
//code
fetch('/path/to/data').then(response => {
  response.json().then(data => {
    data.forEach(item => {
      let newElement = document.createElement("div");
      newElement.innerHTML = item.content;
      container.appendChild(newElement);
    });

                                        - [2]  How to build a page like imgur or pinterest?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Building a web page like Imgur or Pinterest involves several key steps, including designing a layout, creating the functionality for 
displaying and managing images, and setting up a back-end to handle server-side functionality like image storage and retrieval.

**Design the layout: One of the main characteristics of Imgur and Pinterest is the use of a grid layout to display images. To replicate
 this, you will need to create a grid of elements, using techniques like flexbox or CSS grid to arrange the elements in a flexible and 
 responsive manner.
**Create the functionality for displaying and managing images: You will need to create a way to display images on the page, and also to
 handle user interactions like clicking on an image to view a larger version or to post a new image. You can use JavaScript to handle 
 the interactions with the images and to load new images dynamically using techniques like AJAX, to avoid refreshing the whole page.
**Setup a back-end: Setting up a back-end is a key step to handle the storage and retrieval of images and other data. It is where you 
need to handle the user authentication, upload of images, and the interactions with the data like CRUD (create, read, update, delete) 
operations. The back-end can be created using any popular web development frameworks like Express, Ruby on Rails, and Django. You'll 
also have to choose a data storage system, for example, you can use a database like MySQL or MongoDB to store the data.
**Implement search and tagging functionality: You will need to implement a search feature to allow users to search for images by keywords
 or tags. You can use a text search feature like Elasticsearch to implement this functionality.
**Implement social features: Both Imgur and Pinterest allow users to like, share, comment on images and also provide a way to create 
boards and pin images. These features can be implemented using JavaScript on the front-end and with a database on the back-end to track
 and store the data.
Building a page like Imgur and Pinterest can be complex and time-consuming, the key is to break it down into manageable parts and to
 test and refine the different elements of the page as you build it. It is recommended to have a good understanding of web development
  concepts like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as some experience with server-side technologies and database management before attempting
   to build a web page like these.

                                                      - [3]  What are SVGs?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a vector-based graphic format that uses a markup language to describe the shapes, paths, 
and other visual elements of an image. Unlike raster image formats like JPEG and PNG, which are resolution-dependent and can become 
pixelated or distorted when scaled, SVG images are resolution-independent, which means they can be scaled up or down without losing 
quality.

SVG images are made up of a series of mathematical descriptions of the visual elements, which are defined using a markup language 
similar to HTML. The elements are defined using shapes, paths, and other primitives, which can be manipulated and styled using CSS 
and JavaScript.
SVG images are widely supported by web browsers and are becoming increasingly popular for web design and development, as they offer 
a number of advantages over raster images, including:
**Small file size: SVG images tend to be much smaller in file size than raster images, which can help to improve the performance and 
loading time of a web page.
**Resolution-independence: SVG images can be scaled up or down without losing quality, making them ideal for creating responsive 
designs that look great on any device.
**Can be styled with CSS: SVG images can be styled with CSS, which allows you to change their colors, apply transforms and animations, 
and much more.
**Easily editable: Because SVG images are defined using a markup language, they are easy to edit and manipulate using text editors
 and other tools, which can make them more convenient to work with than raster images.
**Accessibility: SVG allows for the creation of accessible images, for example, adding <title> and <desc> tags to describe the content
 of the SVG, it can be understood by assistive technology.
Due to its features and benefits, SVG is widely used in different areas such as icons, illustrations, diagrams and even animations.

                                                    - [4]  How do you animate SVGs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
There are several ways to animate SVGs:

**Using CSS animations: You can animate the properties of an SVG element (such as position, rotation, and color) by applying CSS 
transitions and animations to the element.
**Using JavaScript: You can use JavaScript libraries such as GreenSock or Snap.svg to animate SVG elements. These libraries provide
 a wide range of animation options and make it easy to create complex animations.
**Using SMIL: SVG has its own animation elements, such as <animate>, <animateTransform>, and <animateMotion>. These elements are 
based on the SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) animation standard, which allows you to specify animations directly 
in the SVG markup.
**Using SVG animation tools: there are dedicated animation tool such as Adobe Animate, or Lottie which allow to animate svg using 
keyframes and export to different format and use in web, mobile or After Effects.
**Hybrid option: you could use a combination of the above techniques to achieve the animation you want.

The choice of method depends on the complexity of the animation and the resources available to you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In CSS, a pseudo-element is a keyword that is added to a selector to style a specific part of the selected element(s). 
It is used to select and style a part of an element, rather than the whole element. Examples of pseudo-elements include:

::before - used to insert content before the selected element
::after - used to insert content after the selected element
::first-letter - used to style the first letter of the selected element
::first-line - used to style the first line of the selected element

Pseudo-classes, on the other hand, are used to select and style an element based on its state or properties. 
They are used to select elements based on their attributes or relationship with other elements. Examples of pseudo-classes include:

:hover - used to style an element when a user hovers over it
:active - used to style an element when it is being activated (e.g. clicked on)
:visited - used to style a link after it has been visited
:focus - used to style an element when it has focus
:first-child - used to style the first child element of its parent.

It's important to note that pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes are used in combination with other CSS selectors, 
and the correct syntax is :pseudo-class or ::pseudo-element.

                                    - [4] What are CSS positions? What are the position types in CSS? 
                                               What is the default position property in CSS?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
CSS position property is used to specify the positioning of an element within the document. 
It determines how an element is positioned in relation to its parent element and other elements on the web page.

There are five different position types in CSS:

static: is the default position type. Elements with a static position are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
relative: elements with a relative position can be moved using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. They will still take up space 
in the layout and affect other elements as they normally would.
absolute: elements with an absolute position are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor, but not the viewport. 
They do not take up space in the layout and will not affect other elements.
fixed: elements with a fixed position are positioned relative to the viewport, and will not move when the page is scrolled.
sticky: elements with a sticky position are positioned based on the user's scroll position. They will act like a relative positioned 
element until a certain scroll point is reached and then they will act like a fixed positioned element.
The default position property in CSS is static, which means that elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document 
and not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
