-                                                     [1]  What is redux?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Redux is a JavaScript library that is commonly used with React to manage the state of an application. It provides a way to 
centralize the management of an application's state, making it easier to understand and predict the flow of data in an application.

The main concepts in Redux are:

The store: a JavaScript object that holds the current state of the application.
The state: the data that represents the current state of the application.
The actions: JavaScript objects that describe the changes that should be made to the state.
The reducers: JavaScript functions that take the current state and an action as input, and return a new state.
The basic flow of data in a Redux application is as follows:

An action is dispatched, which describes a change that should be made to the state.
The store sends the action to all of the reducers.
The reducers update the state based on the action, and return the new state.
The store updates its state with the new state returned by the reducers.
The React components that are connected to the store re-render with the new state.
The main benefits of using Redux are:

Centralizing the management of state makes it easier to understand and predict the flow of data in an application.
The state is read-only, which means that the only way to change it is by dispatching actions. This makes it easy to track and debug
 changes to the state.
The reducers are pure functions, which means that they don't have side effects, making them predictable and easy to test.
It's important to note that Redux is not limited to React, it can be used with other libraries and frameworks, but it's mostly used 
with React.

-                                                       [2]  What are actions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In Redux, actions are JavaScript objects that describe the changes that should be made to the state of the application. They are the
 only way to change the state of the application and are dispatched to the store by the application's components.

An action typically has two properties: a type property and a payload property. The type property describes the type of action being
 performed, and the payload property contains any additional data needed to perform the action.

Here's an example of a simple action:

Copy code
{
    type: 'ADD_TODO',
    payload: 'Learn Redux'
}
In this example, the type property is set to ADD_TODO, and the payload property is set to 'Learn Redux'. This action describes the
 intent to add a new todo item with the text 'Learn Redux'.

Actions are typically created by action creators, which are functions that return an action object. Here's an example of an action
 creator for the above action:

Copy code
function addTodo(text) {
    return {
        type: 'ADD_TODO',
        payload: text
    }
}
In this example, the addTodo function takes a single argument text and returns an action object with a type of ADD_TODO and a payload 
of text.

It's important to note that actions should be plain objects and should not have any side effects (like API calls or DOM updates). 
They should also be serializable so that they can be logged, stored and replaye
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-                                                     [3]  What are action creators?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In Redux, action creators are functions that create and return actions. They are used to generate the action objects that describe 
the changes that should be made to the state of the application.
An action creator typically takes some arguments, such as data that is needed to perform the action, and returns an action object.
Here's an example of an action creator for a simple "add todo" action:

Copy code
function addTodo(text) {
    return {
        type: 'ADD_TODO',
        payload: text
    }
}
In this example, the addTodo function takes a single argument text and returns an action object with a type of ADD_TODO and a payload 
of text.
Once the action object is returned by the action creator, it can be dispatched to the store by calling store.dispatch(addTodo(text))
It's important to note that action creators should be pure functions, meaning that they should not have any side effects (like API 
calls or DOM updates), and should only return an action object.
It's also important to note that action creators are not required in Redux, you can create and dispatch actions directly if you 
want to. However, using action creators makes it easier to test your application, as well as make your code more readable and easier
 to understand.

-                                                     [6]  What are pure functions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In programming, a pure function is a function that has the following characteristics:

It always returns the same output for the same input.
It doesn't have any side effects.
It doesn't rely on or modify any variables or state outside of its scope.
A pure function is also called a deterministic function because it always returns the same output for the same input values, 
regardless of when or how many times it's called.

Here's an example of a simple pure function:

Copy code
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
In this example, the add function takes two arguments a and b and returns the sum of both. The function is pure as it always returns 
the same output for the same input, it doesn't have any side effects and it doesn't rely or modify any variables or state outside of 
its scope.

Here's an example of a non-pure function:

Copy code
let x = 0;

function add() {
    x++;
    return x;
}
In this example, the add function increments a global variable x and returns its value. This function is non-pure as it's output 
changes depending on when and how many times it's called, it modifies a variable outside of its scope, and it has side effects 
(modifying a variable).

Pure functions are beneficial in several ways, such as they are easy to test, reason about, and understand. They also make the code 
more predictable and easier to debug, and make it easier to reason about the order of execution. In Redux, reducers are expected to 
be pure functions, as they take the current state and an action and return a new state
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-                                [7]  Why do we spread the state or return a new object in reducers?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In Redux, reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state. They are the only way to 
update the state of the application.

It's important to note that the state in Redux is immutable, meaning that the state should not be modified directly, but rather a new
 state should be created and returned by the reducer.

One way to create a new state object is to use the spread operator ... to create a new object with the properties of the current state
 and the new properties that should be updated.

Here's an example of a simple reducer that updates a todo item:

Copy code
function todos(state = [], action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'UPDATE_TODO':
            return state.map(todo => {
                if (todo.id === action.payload.id) {
                    return { ...todo, ...action.payload.updates }
                }
                return todo
            })
        default:
            return state
    }
}
In this example, the todos reducer takes the current state and an action as input. When the action type is UPDATE_TODO, the reducer 
maps over the state, and for the todo item whose id matches the id in the payload, it returns a new object which is created by 
spreading the properties of the current todo object and the updates from payload.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-                                   [8]  Why do dispatchers take only actions which are objects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In Redux, the dispatch function is the mechanism used to send actions to the store. It is typically a method of the store object that
 takes an action object as its argument.

Dispatchers take only actions which are objects because actions should be plain JavaScript objects and should not have any side 
effects (like API calls or DOM updates). They should also be serializable so that they can be logged, stored, and replayed.

Objects are a convenient way to package all the information needed to describe an action in a single, serializable entity. They 
allow you to include a type property that describes the type of action being performed, and a payload property that contains any 
additional data needed to perform the action.

By using objects, actions can be easily logged, stored and replayed. This means that, in case of any issues, you can easily recreate
 the state of the application by replaying the recorded actions in the same order, making it easier to debug and test your application.

Additionally, by only dispatching plain objects, it makes the code more predictable and easier to understand, since there are no
 surprises as to what the dispatcher will do, it will only process plain javascript objects.

It's important to note that the dispatch function is the only way to change the state in a Redux application, and it's a mechanism
 to tell the store that an action is occurring, and the action must be a plain javascript object.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-                                         [9]  What are types in actions why do we need them?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In Redux, actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe the changes that should be made to the state of the application. 
They are the only way to change the state of the application and are dispatched to the store by the application's components.

One of the properties of an action object is the type property, which is used to describe the type of action being performed. 
The type property is a string that identifies the action, and it should be unique across the application.

The type property is used by the reducers to determine how to update the state based on the action. In a reducer, you'll typically
 use a switch statement or if-else statements to check the type property of the action, and update the state accordingly.

Here's an example of a simple reducer that updates a todo item:

Copy code
function todos(state = [], action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'UPDATE_TODO':
            // update the todo item
            return updatedState
        case 'DELETE_TODO':
            // delete the todo item
            return updatedState
        default:
            return state
    }
}
In this example, the todos reducer takes the current state and an action as input. When the action type is UPDATE_TODO, 
the reducer updates the todo item in the state and when the action type is DELETE_TODO, it deletes the todo item in the state.

By using type property in actions, it makes it clear as to what the action is doing and it also makes it easier to reason about and 
debug the code, as you can see what each action does by just looking at the type. Also, it helps to organize the code and make it more 
readable.

It's important to note that the type property should be a string, and it should be unique across the application. It's also a best
 practice to keep the type property in a separate file, for example, actionTypes.js, to avoid typos and inconsistencies.

-                                   [10]  What happens when you pass a function into a dispatcher?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In Redux, the dispatch function is used to send actions to the store. It is typically a method of the store object that takes an 
action object as its argument.

When you pass a function into a dispatcher, the function is not executed, instead it is ignored. The reason is that, the dispatch 
function expects an action object, which is a plain JavaScript object that describes the changes that should be made to the state 
of the application. A function is not a plain JavaScript object, it's an executable code, and passing a function into the dispatcher 
would not make sense in this context.

If you want to perform some logic or async operations, such as making an API call, before you dispatch an action, you should use 
middleware such as redux-thunk.

Redux-thunk is a middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. This function can
 then be used to perform the async logic, like making an API call, and then dispatch the action object.

Here's an example of how you might use redux-thunk to handle an API call:

Copy code
// action creator
export function fetchUsers() {
    return function(dispatch) {
        axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
            .then(response => {
                dispatch({type: 'FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS', payload: response.data});
            })
            .catch(error => {
                dispatch({type: 'FETCH_USERS_FAILURE', payload: error});
            });
    }
}
In this example, the fetchUsers is an action creator that returns a function that performs the API call and dispatches an action 
object with the type FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS or FETCH_USERS_FAILURE accordingly.

It's important to note that to use thunk, you need to add the redux-thunk middleware to your store, like this:

Copy code
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
So, passing a function into a dispatcher without any middleware such as redux-thunk will not work and the function will be ignored.

-                                                    [11] Where do dispatchers come from?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In Redux, a dispatcher is a mechanism used to send actions to the store. The dispatch function is typically a method of the store 
object that takes an action object as its argument.

In a Redux application, the store is created using the createStore function from the redux library. The createStore function takes the
 root reducer as its argument, and it returns an object that contains the dispatch method.

Here's an example of how you might create a store in a Redux application:

Copy code
import { createStore } from 'redux'
import rootReducer from './reducers'

const store = createStore(rootReducer)
In this example, the createStore function is called with the rootReducer as its argument, and it returns an object that has the dispatch
 method, which can be used to send actions to the store.

It's also important to note that you can use the useDispatch hook from the react-redux library to get the dispatch function in your 
functional components so that you can dispatch actions.

Copy code
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux'

function TodoForm({ addTodo }) {
  const dispatch = useDispatch()
  const [text, setText] = useState('')

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    dispatch(addTodo(text))
    setText('')
  }
  //...
}
In this example, the TodoForm component uses the useDispatch hook from the react-redux library to get the dispatch function, which 
can be used to send the addTodo action to the store.

So in summary, dispatchers come from the store object, which is created using the createStore function from the redux library, and it 
can also be accessed via the useDispatch hook from the react-redux library.

-                                                [12]  What are the properties of a store?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In Redux, a store is an object that holds the state of the application and provides a way to update the state. A store has the 
following properties:

getState(): This method returns the current state of the application.

dispatch(action): This method is used to send actions to the store. It takes an action object as its argument and dispatches it to 
the root reducer.

subscribe(listener): This method is used to register a callback function that will be called every time an action is dispatched. 
The listener function is called with the current state as its argument.

replaceReducer(nextReducer): This method is used to replace the root reducer with a new one. This can be useful for hot-reloading 
or for dynamic code splitting of the reducer.

[Symbol.observable](): This method is used to create an observable that can be used with the observability API.

It's important to note that the store is created using the createStore function from the redux library. The createStore function 
takes the root reducer as its argument and returns the store object that has the properties mentioned above.

Here's an example of how you might create a store in a Redux application:

Copy code
import { createStore } from 'redux'
import rootReducer from './reducers'

const store = createStore(rootReducer)
In this example, the createStore function is called with the rootReducer as its argument, and it returns the store object that has
 the getState, dispatch, subscribe, replaceReducer and [Symbol.observable] methods.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-                                 [13]  Can you create your own redux and create the following methods?
                                          dispatchers | constructor | getState | subscribe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Yes, it is possible to create your own Redux implementation. Here's an example of how you might create a custom store with dispatchers,
 a constructor, getState and subscribe methods:

Copy code
class Store {
    constructor(reducer, initialState) {
        this.reducer = reducer;
        this.state = initialState;
        this.listeners = [];
    }

    getState() {
        return this.state;
    }

    dispatch(action) {
        this.state = this.reducer(this.state, action);
        this.listeners.forEach(listener => listener());
    }

    subscribe(listener) {
        this.listeners.push(listener);
        return () => {
            this.listeners = this.listeners.filter(l => l !== listener);
        }
    }
}
In this example, the Store class has a constructor that takes a reducer function and an initialState as its arguments. 
The constructor also initializes an empty array of listeners.

The getState method returns the current state of the application.

The dispatch method takes an action as an argument and passes it to the reducer function along with the current state. The returned
 value becomes the new state, and then the method calls each listener function registered using the subscribe method.

The subscribe method takes a listener function as its argument and pushes it to the listeners array. It also returns a function that
 when called will remove the listener from the array.

It's important to note that this is just a basic implementation of a custom store and it may not have all the features and 
functionalities of the official Redux store.

You can use this custom store to create your own redux implementation, but in the real-world scenario, it's recommend to use the 
official redux implementation as it is widely used and has a lot of features and functionalities that are battle-tested and proven.

-                                                [14]  Explain redux to a 5 year old?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Redux is a way to keep track of things in a computer game or program, like keeping score or remembering what level you are on. 
Imagine you have a box that stores all the important information for the game, like the score and the level. This box is called the
 "store."

When you play the game and do something like getting a point or moving to the next level, you need to tell the store to update the 
score or level. To do this, you send a message to the store called an "action." The action tells the store what you did, like 
"I got a point" or "I moved to the next level."

The store also has a special helper called a "reducer" that knows how to change the information in the store based on the actions 
it receives. The reducer is like a recipe book that tells the store how to update the information.

For example, the store might have a recipe that says, "if the action is 'I got a point' then add one to the score." The reducer follows 
this recipe and updates the score in the store.

Now the store has the updated information, and the game can use it to show you the new score or level on the screen. This is how Redux
 helps to keep track of things in a computer game or program.

-                                     [15]  What is the difference between Context API and Redux?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Context API and Redux are both used to manage state in a React application, but they work in different ways.

The Context API is a built-in feature of React that allows you to share state across components without having to pass props down through 
multiple levels of the 
component tree. It allows you to create a context object, which can be consumed by any component in the tree.

Redux, on the other hand, is a separate library that is often used in conjunction with React. It provides a centralized store for the 
state of the application, and it allows you to manage the state using the principles of a predictable state container. With Redux, 
you define actions and reducers, which describe how the state should change in response to actions.

One key difference between the two is that Context API is a built-in feature of React and it is more simpler to use, it's good for 
small to medium-sized applications. On the other hand, Redux is a separate library and it is more complex to use but it is more 
powerful and it is good for large-scale applications.

Another difference is that, with Redux, all the state updates must go through the store, which allows for better control and 
management of the state updates. However, with Context API, state updates can happen anywhere in the component tree, which can 
make it more difficult to trace and debug state changes.

So, the choice between using Context API or Redux depends on the size and complexity of your application and the specific 
requirements of your use case.

-                                                      [16]  What are redux thunks?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action object. 
This function, called a thunk, can be used to perform asynchronous logic, such as making an API call, before dispatching an action.

A thunk is a function that wraps an expression to delay its evaluation. In the case of Redux, a thunk is a function that wraps an action
creator and returns a new action creator. The new action creator, when called, will dispatch the original action creator but only after
performing some async logic, like making an API call.

Here's an example of how you might use Redux Thunk to handle an API call:

Copy code
// action creator
export function fetchUsers() {
    return function(dispatch) {
        // Dispatching the request action
        dispatch({type: 'FETCH_USERS_REQUEST'});
        axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
            .then(response => {
                // Dispatching the success action
                const users = response.data;
                dispatch({type: 'FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS', payload: users});
            })
            .catch(error => {
                // Dispatching the failure action
                const errorMsg = error.message;
                dispatch({type: 'FETCH_USERS_FAILURE', payload: errorMsg});
            });
    }
}
In this example, the fetchUsers is an action creator that returns a thunk, which when invoked, performs the API call and dispatches 
actions with the type FETCH_USERS_REQUEST, FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS, or FETCH_USERS_FAILURE accordingly.

It's important to note that to use thunk, you need to add the redux-thunk middleware to your store, like this:

Copy code
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-                                          [17]  Why do we need to use network requests in redux thunks?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
We use network requests (such as API calls) in Redux Thunks because they are often asynchronous, meaning that they don't complete 
immediately and we need a way to handle the response or any errors that may occur.

Using thunks allows us to handle async logic, like making a network request, in a way that fits in with the overall flow of a 
Redux application. With thunks, we can dispatch actions that reflect the status of the network request, such as "FETCH_USERS_REQUEST",
"FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS", and "FETCH_USERS_FAILURE", to update the state of the application accordingly.

This way we can handle the flow of the async request, like handling the loading state, error handling, etc. It also keeps the component
simple and the network logic in one place, the thunk function, rather than spreading the logic throughout the component tree.

Furthermore, by using thunks, we can handle async logic in a consistent way across the application, rather than having different 
components handle async logic in different ways, this makes it easy to follow the flow of the request and also maintain the code.

In summary, using Redux thunks for network requests allows us to handle async logic in a way that fits in with the overall flow of a
Redux application, handle the request status, and maintain a consistent way of handling async logic throughout the application.

-                                                       [18]  What are middlewares?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In Redux, a middleware is a third-party library that sits between the store's dispatch method and the reducer. It is a way to extend 
the functionality of the store's dispatch method and handle tasks such as logging, crash reporting, performing async operations, 
and more.

A middleware is a function that takes the store's dispatch function and the getState function as arguments, and returns a new 
function that can be used to dispatch actions. This new function, called the next, typically does something with the action before 
or after passing it to the store's dispatch method.

For example, a logging middleware might log the action to the console before it is passed to the store's dispatch method, and an 
async middleware like redux-thunk allows you to dispatch a function instead of an action, which can contain async logic like making 
an API call.

Here's an example of how you might use a middleware in your Redux application:

Copy code
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import logger from 'redux-logger';

const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(logger));
In this example, the applyMiddleware function is used to apply the logger middleware to the store. This means that every action 
that is dispatched will be logged to the console by the logger middleware before it is passed to the store's dispatch method.

It's important to note that middlewares are just another way of extending the functionality of the store and allows for an easier 
way to handle specific tasks, it is not required to use middlewares to use redux, but it is a useful pattern to handle tasks that 
are not related to updating the state.

-                            [19]  Can you write your own middleware instead of thunks? what do thunks do?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Yes, it is possible to write your own middleware for managing asynchronous actions in a Redux application instead of using thunks. 
A thunk is a specific kind of middleware that allows for the dispatching of functions in addition to the standard dispatching of objects.
 These functions can then be used to perform any necessary async logic before dispatching the actual action object.

Thunks are a way to handle side effects in Redux. They are a way to handle async logic in Redux. They are a way to handle async logic
 in Redux. They are a way to handle async logic in Redux. They are a way to handle async logic in Redux. They are a way to handle async

-                                     [20]  Explain with a diagram how state gets updated with redux?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Redux follows a strict unidirectional data flow, meaning that the state flows in a single direction through the application. 
The diagram below illustrates this process:

An action, which is an object describing a change that needs to be made to the state, is dispatched by a component or other part
 of the application.

The action is received by the Redux store, which is responsible for managing the state of the application.

The store then passes the action to all of its reducers. Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action as 
inputs and return a new state.

Each reducer examines the action and modifies the state accordingly. The new state is then returned to the store.

The store updates its state with the new state returned by the reducer.

The new state is passed down to the connected components of the application through props, which causes the components to re-render 
with the updated state.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-                                                       [21]  What is useSelector?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
useSelector is a hook provided by the react-redux library, which allows a React component to access the Redux store state and 
re-render when the state changes.

useSelector accepts a selector function as its argument, which is a function that takes the current Redux store state as an input and
 returns a piece of the state that is needed by the component. The hook then subscribes the component to the Redux store and re-renders
  the component whenever the returned state value changes.

This allows for more efficient updates because the component only re-renders when the specific piece of state it needs has changed, 
rather than re-rendering every time any piece of state changes.

For example, you can use useSelector in a component like this:

Copy code
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

function MyComponent() {
  const user = useSelector(state => state.user);

  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}
Here, useSelector is used to access the user property of the Redux store state, and the component re-renders whenever the user state changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-                                        [22]  What is the compareFn that you pass in a useSelector?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
The compareFn is an optional argument that can be passed to the useSelector hook. It is a function that compares the previous and current
 state values and returns a Boolean indicating whether the component should re-render or not.

The compareFn receives the previous state and the current state as arguments and should return true if the component should re-render,
 and false otherwise.

For example, if you want to re-render the component only when the user object has changed, you can pass a compare function like this:

Copy code
const user = useSelector(state => state.user, (prev, next) => prev.id !== next.id);
This function compares the previous and current id properties of the user object, and will return true if they are different, causing 
the component to re-render. If the id property is the same, the component will not re-render.

It's worth noting that by default, useSelector uses a strict equality check (Object.is) to compare the previous and next state, which 
means that if the state is an object or an array and you mutate it, even if it's the same, the component will re-render. This can be 
solved by passing a custom compareFn to compare values that are important for the component, or by using useMemo to keep the state from
 mutating.

-                                                       [23]  What is useDispatch?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
useDispatch is a hook provided by the react-redux library, which allows a React component to dispatch actions to the Redux store.

useDispatch is a hook that returns the dispatch function from the store, which can be used to dispatch an action to the store.
When an action is dispatched, it is passed to the reducers, which update the state of the store accordingly.

For example, you can use useDispatch in a component like this:

Copy code
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { addTodo } from './actions';

function AddTodoForm() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const todo = event.target.elements.todo.value;
    dispatch(addTodo(todo));
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input name="todo" placeholder="Add Todo" />
      <button type="submit">Add</button>
    </form>
  );
}
Here, useDispatch is used to call the dispatch function, which will call the addTodo action creator, passing the todo value as a 
parameter, and then it will be passed to the store, the store will pass it to the corresponding reducer and the state will be updated.

It's worth noting that useDispatch doesn't need to be used inside a component, you can use it inside a custom hook, utility 
function or even inside another middleware.

-                                                 [24]  What is the use of Provider?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
The Provider component is a component provided by the react-redux library, which allows your React components to access the Redux store.

The Provider component is used at the root of your React application, and it wraps your entire application. It takes the Redux store 
as a prop and makes it available to all of the components in your application.

For example, you can use the Provider component like this:

Copy code
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';

function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <RootComponent />
    </Provider>
  );
}
Here, the Provider component is wrapping the RootComponent and passing the store as prop. This makes the store available to all the 
components inside RootComponent and its child components, and they can use the useSelector and useDispatch hooks to access the state 
and dispatch actions.

It's worth noting that the Provider component is not needed when using the connect HOC, because connect will take care of providing the 
store to the component, but it's still needed if you want to use the hoo

-                                      [25]  what is redux tool kit? How does it make redux better?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Redux Toolkit is a set of tools that simplifies the setup and development process of Redux. It provides a way to configure a new or 
existing Redux store with a few lines of code, and also includes features that make it easier to manage the state and actions in your 
application.

Some of the features of Redux Toolkit include:

A createAsyncThunk helper function that simplifies the creation of async thunks.
A createSlice helper function that makes it easy to create and manage the actions and reducers for a specific slice of the state.
A configureStore function that sets up the store with the necessary middleware, such as the thunk middleware for handling async actions,
 and the ability to add custom middleware and enhancers.
A immer library integration that allows you to write your reducers in a more intuitive and less error-prone way by mutating the state 
directly instead of creating a new copy.
A createAsyncThunk that simplify the creation of async thunks.
By using Redux Toolkit, you can set up a new or existing store in a few lines of code, which eliminates the need to manually configure
 the store with middleware, enhancers, and other boilerplate. Also, it provides a way to write your reducer, actions and async actions
  in a more readable and maintainable way.

Overall, Redux Toolkit makes Redux development more efficient, less error-prone and more maintainable by providing a set of powerful 
tools to handle common use cases that you encounter when developing with Redux.

                                              [26]  What does Object.freeze() do?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Object.freeze() is a method in JavaScript that makes an object immutable, meaning its properties cannot be modified or deleted.
Once an object is frozen, any attempts to add, modify, or delete properties from it will have no effect. The object will remain in 
its frozen state. This can be useful for ensuring the integrity of an object that should not be modified accidentally or by other code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            [27] Why is immutability required by Redux ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In Redux, the state of the entire application is stored in a single, immutable object. This means that instead of modifying the 
state directly, new versions of the state are created with the desired changes.

This has several benefits:

It makes it easy to track changes to the state over time, since each new version of the state is a new object.
It makes it easy to implement undo/redo functionality, since previous versions of the state can be easily accessed.
It makes it easy to detect when the state has changed, since any comparison between the current state and a previous state will show 
that they are different objects.

It ensures that the state of the application can't be modified accidentally or by other code, which can help avoid bugs.
Overall, immutability in Redux helps in easy state management, debugging and in maintaining predictable state.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                         [28]  How does Redux use shallow equality checking ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
In Redux, the store's state is updated by dispatching actions. When an action is dispatched, the store's reducer function is called with
 the current state and the action as arguments, and it returns a new state.

Shallow equality checking is used to determine whether the new state is the same as the previous state. Specifically, Redux uses the 
Object.is method for shallow equality checking, which is a more efficient way to compare objects than the === operator.

When the new state and the previous state are the same object, the store will not dispatch a change event and the components will not 
re-render. This is called as the shallow comparison.

Shallow equality checking is used in Redux to improve performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders of components. It also avoids 
unnecessary updates, which can be especially useful in large and complex applications.

Additionally, Redux uses the Object.is method for shallow equality checking, as it is more efficient and consistent than the traditional
 === operator, which has certain edge cases where it behaves differently.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                [29] How well does Redux “scale” in terms of performance and architecture ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Redux is a predictable state container that can help manage the state of large and complex applications. It allows for a centralized, 
immutable state and a predictable way of updating the state through reducers, which can make it easier to reason about the state of the
 application and debug issues.

In terms of performance, Redux can be optimized to work well with large and complex applications by implementing a few best practices:

Use shallow equality checking to prevent unnecessary re-renders
Avoid unnecessary updates by using immutable data structures
Use the reselect library for creating memoized selectors to avoid recomputing derived data
However, as the complexity of the application increases, the number of actions and reducers also increases, which can make it harder to
 manage and understand the application's state. This can lead to a large number of action types, switch statements and if-else conditions
  in the reducers.

To mitigate this, one can use the Ducks pattern which groups actions, action types and reducers in a single module and use middleware to
 handle side-effects. Additionally, one can use the Redux-toolkit which is an official set of opinionated packages that help you write 
 efficient and maintainable Redux code.

In terms of architecture, if an application is small and simple, then it might be okay to have a single store and one set of reducers to 
handle the state. However, as the application grows, it may be beneficial to split the state into smaller, more manageable stores and use
 the redux-saga or redux-thunk for handling async actions.

Overall, Redux is a powerful tool for managing the state of large and complex applications but, as with any tool, it's important to 
understand its limitations and best practices for using it to avoid performance and architecture issues.

                                       [30]  How does Redux compare to the React Context API ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Redux and the React Context API are both tools for managing the state of a React application, but they have some key differences:

Scope: Redux is a global state management library that allows you to manage the state of your entire application in a centralized, 
immutable store. The React Context API, on the other hand, is a way to share state between components without passing props down 
through multiple levels of the component tree. The Context API is more focused on managing state at a local or component level.

Predictability: Because Redux has a centralized store and uses a strict unidirectional data flow, it can make it easier to reason about
 the state of the application and debug issues. The React Context API, on the other hand, does not enforce a specific pattern for how 
 state should be updated, which can make it harder to predict how changes to the state will affect the rest of the application.

Performance: Because Redux uses shallow equality checking and immutable data structures, it can be optimized for performance in large
 and complex applications. The React Context API does not provide these optimization out of the box, however, React.memo and useEffect 
 hooks can be used for optimization.

Complexity: Redux can be more complex to set up and use than the React Context API, especially for small and simple applications. Redux
 requires you to set up a store, actions, and reducers, whereas the React Context API can be used with just a few lines of code.

In summary, Redux and the React Context API are both useful tools for managing state in React applications, but they have different
 scopes and trade-offs. Redux is a global state management library that is well-suited for large and complex applications, while the 
 React Context API is more focused on managing state at a local or component level.

                                                    [31] What is webpack ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. It is used to take all the different files and dependencies of an application, 
such as JavaScript, CSS, images, and more, and bundle them into a single file (or a few files) that can be loaded by a web browser.

Webpack processes all the files in the application and builds a dependency graph that shows which files depend on which other files.
 It then uses this graph to determine the optimal way to bundle the files together.

Webpack also has the ability to process and transform files using loaders, which are plugins that allow you to preprocess files as they 
are added to the dependency graph. For example, you can use a loader to transpile modern JavaScript code to an older version that is 
compatible with more browsers, or to process and optimize images.

Additionally, Webpack has a development server that allows you to run your application locally and see changes in real-time as you make
 them. It also supports hot module replacement, which allows you to update modules in the browser without refreshing the page.

Webpack is a powerful tool that can help you optimize the performance of your application and make the development process more efficient.
 It is widely used to bundle JavaScript applications, and it is supported by many popular frameworks and libraries, such as React and 
 Angular.

                                                      [32] What is treeshaking ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANS.
Tree shaking is a technique used by modern bundlers like Webpack to eliminate unused code from the final bundled output. The idea 
behind tree shaking is that not all the code in an application will be used at runtime, so there's no need to include that unused 
code in the final bundle.

When building the bundle, the bundler starts with the entry point of the application and follows the import statements to build a 
dependency graph of all the modules used by the application. Once the graph is built, the bundler can analyze which modules are 
actually used and which are not, and only include the used modules in the final bundle.

Tree shaking can significantly reduce the size of the final bundle and improve the performance of the application by only including 
the code that is actually used. It can also help to keep the bundle size small and efficient, especially when using large libraries.

It is important to note that tree shaking only works with the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) module syntax (i.e. import and export) , and not 
with CommonJS or AMD module systems.

Tree shaking can also be used in combination with other optimization techniques such as code splitting and minification to further 
improve the performance of the application.

code splitting, and more.

Code splitting: Webpack allows you to split your code into smaller chunks, which can be loaded on demand, improving the initial load 
time of your application.

Hot Module Replacement (HMR): Webpack supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR), which allows you to update modules in the browser without 
refreshing the page, improving the development experience.

Tree shaking: Webpack uses tree shaking to eliminate unused code from the final bundled output, which can significantly reduce the size 
of the final bundle and improve the performance of the application.

Source maps: Webpack generates source maps, which allows you to debug your application in the browser as if you were running the 
un-bundled code, making it easier to find and fix bugs.

DevServer: Webpack comes with a development server that allows you to run your application locally and see changes in real-time as you 
make them, which can improve the development experience.

These are some of the key features of webpack, and it offers many more options and possibilities that can be used to improve the 
performance and development experience of your application.
